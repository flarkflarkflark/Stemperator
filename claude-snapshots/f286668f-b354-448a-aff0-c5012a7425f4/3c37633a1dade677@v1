## 2. DALL-E 3 (ChatGPT Plus / Bing Image Creator)

**Website:** https://chat.openai.com/ of https://www.bing.com/images/create

### Prompt 1: Hero Image - Stem Separation Concept

```
Create a professional software interface screenshot showing an AI-powered audio stem separation tool. The image should show a dark-themed audio editor with a single waveform on the left being processed and split into 4 separate colored waveform tracks on the right: red (vocals), blue (drums), purple (bass), and green (other instruments). Include subtle AI/neural network visual elements. Modern, clean design with the text "Stemperator" visible. Aspect ratio 16:9.
```

### Prompt 2: Before/After Comparison

```
Create a split-screen comparison image for audio software. Left side labeled "BEFORE" shows a single complex audio waveform in white/grey. Right side labeled "AFTER" shows the same audio separated into 4 clean individual tracks with distinct colors: coral red for vocals, sky blue for drums, violet for bass, mint green for other. Dark background, professional music production aesthetic. Include small icons next to each track (microphone, drum, bass guitar, keyboard). 16:9 aspect ratio.
```

### Prompt 3: Creative Workflow Scene

```
Digital illustration of a music producer's perspective looking at a computer monitor. The screen shows a DAW (digital audio workstation) with the Stemperator plugin open. Visible are 4 separated audio tracks with colored waveforms (red, blue, purple, green) and a floating dialog box with checkboxes for "Vocals, Drums, Bass, Other". Atmospheric lighting, professional studio environment suggested in the background blur. Modern and sleek aesthetic.

```

### Prompt 2: Feature Highlight Image

```
Professional software marketing image. Dark background with text "STEMPERATOR" in modern sans-serif font at top. Below, 4 horizontal audio waveforms stacked vertically, each in different color: coral red labeled "VOCALS", cyan blue labeled "DRUMS", purple labeled "BASS", mint green labeled "OTHER". Subtle glow effect on waveforms. Text at bottom: "AI-Powered Stem Separation". Clean, minimal design. 16:9 aspect ratio.
```

### Prompt 3: Workflow Diagram

```
Technical infographic showing audio stem separation process. Left: icon of audio file with musical notes. Center: box labeled "Stemperator AI" with circuit/neural pattern. Right: 4 branching arrows leading to 4 icons - microphone (red), drums (blue), bass guitar (purple), piano keyboard (green). Dark theme, modern flat design, professional music technology aesthetic. Text labels clearly readable. Horizontal layout, 16:9.
